      That would be 13 technologies introduced in just the first week! Whew. 
      Thankfully I grew up on DOS machines and command line has continued to
      be useful for troubleshooting on Windows machines ever since, so using
      the command line on a UNIX system was basically just reconditioning my
      brain for the difference in commands. Really, the same goes for HTML and
      CSS. Both were technologies I dabbled with for fun growing up and never
      really forgot, just like riding a bike! The rest, however, were going to
      have to be learned... and quickly.

      At first it seemed crazy to me that our instructors would introduce new
      technologies every single day while I was still trying to wrap my
      head around what we had learned an hour ago. This is where that "learning
      how to learn" phrase really came into play. All of this tech, while new to
      me, would make things easier for me in the long run. For example, that 
      simple little website I set up for prework and spent literal <i>days</i> 
      fiddling with CSS elements on would have taken me minutes after learning
      more about Bootstrap and SASS, not to mention setting up a Gulp workflow
      to automate repetitive tasks (and its built on JavaScript! I got my
      intro to JS without even realizing it!).
      </p>

      We set up package managers like Homebrew and npm to help us get started
      down this new path of becoming a full stack web developer. We learned
      about node and hosting our apps on Heroku. We set up our homepages (yes, 
      the one you're visiting right now!) with Github Pages. By the end of 
      the week I was exhausted, but it wasn't until I had some time to reflect
      that I realized exactly <i>why</i> so much got crammed into the first week.
      We needed it. I needed it. All of it. There has not been a single piece of 
      tech that we covered the first week that I didn't need.

      Here's to next week. Bring it on. I'm ready for more!
